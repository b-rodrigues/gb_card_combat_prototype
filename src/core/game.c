     * reveals it at the new screen's position once the redraw is done.

     *  - rc->valid == false: screen change / boot / restart (reset);

     *    the render cache, so overworld_screen_render() wipes the display
     *    based only on the map_id mismatch.  The condition mirrors that
     *    branch.

     * three fire: prev_map_id was initialized to the current map at the
     * last reset and the map does not change while those screens are up,
     * so the sprite is NOT re-hidden every frame.  That per-frame re-hide
