     * sprite must not float over the wipe at a stale position.  The
     * frame-boundary commit (ui_sprite_commit in main.c, after vsync)
     * reveals it at the new screen's position once the redraw is done.
     *
     * The three triggers are distinct:
     *  - rc->valid == false: screen change / boot / restart (reset);
     *  - prev_screen != g->screen: a transition whose reset pre-dates the
     *    render (both halves of a frame with a screen change);

     *    world_change_map() without a screen change and without resetting
     *    the render cache, so overworld_screen_render() wipes the display
     *    based only on the map_id mismatch.  The condition mirrors that
     *    branch.
     *
     * On steady non-overworld frames (battle/dialogue/menu) none of the
     * three fire: prev_map_id was initialized to the current map at the
     * last reset and the map does not change while those screens are up,
     * so the sprite is NOT re-hidden every frame.  That per-frame re-hide
     * (from the old 255 prev_map_id sentinel) made the sprite invisible
     * for the whole fight/discussion on real hardware. */
