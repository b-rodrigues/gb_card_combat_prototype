/* Generic progression mechanic.  A progression target is anything in the
 * game that can progress (hero, weapon, card, companion, ...).  The engine
 * does NOT know what a target type means; it only maps a target to a static
 * ProgressionDefinition (max level + thresholds) and mutates its
 * ProgressionState.  Consequences of a level-up are handled by the caller
 * (the game-specific layer), not by this engine. */
