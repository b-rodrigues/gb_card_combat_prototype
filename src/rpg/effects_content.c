/* ── Banked effect resolution (docs/combo-system.md Phase B/C) ───────
 * Runs inside the combo_resolve() dispatch (ROM bank 2): the combo body
 * calls effect_resolve_into() bank-locally after evaluating hand shape.
 * Self-contained: pure function of its arguments; writes the shared
 * g_effect_last slot (WRAM) and/or the caller's out pointer; never calls
 * fixed-bank code.
 *
 * Scaling: amount = base_power x multiplier / 100, where multiplier is
 * the tier percent (+25 suited) from the evaluator.  The multiply and
 * divide are hand-rolled shift-add / subtract-loops because SDCC lowers
 * the operators to __mulint/__divuint -- library code that links into
 * the FIXED bank and cannot be called while bank 2 is mapped
 * (AGENTS.md 52.11.1).
 *
 * Every resolved effect currently scales the same way; when per-effect
 * scaling arrives (plan §10 EffectScaling), each case here grows its own
 * response to combo quality. */
