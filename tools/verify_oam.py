"""Verify the player-sprite transition-hide via OAM (mGBA debugger).

The player is an OAM sprite (shadow OAM at 0xC000, real OAM at 0xFE00).
On any full-screen transition (screen change OR map change) the sprite must
be hidden before the redraw's wipe begins and reappear, at the new screen's
position, via the frame-boundary commit.

This drives the debug ROM through two transitions and asserts the sprite's
OAM state at deterministic pauses.  Values are CAMERA-RELATIVE: since the
smooth SCX/SCY scroll (B3) the sprite's OAM position is
(world_px - camera_px) + GBDK's +8/+16 OAM offset, so it is NOT the
world-tile*8 position the overworld renderer used before the scroll.

  Battle transition  (first_encounter): player (13,8), camera (24,0)
                     -> overworld shadow OAM (y=80,x=88) -> after walking
                     into the slime, battle sprite hidden (y=0) -> after the
                     item screen toggle the sprite stays hidden in battle (y=0).
  Steady battle frame: the sprite must NOT be re-hidden every frame (the
                     old prev_map_id=255 reset sentinel re-ran the hide on
                     every non-overworld frame, keeping the sprite hidden
                     for the whole fight on real hardware).  Detected by
                     breakpoint, since the harness's vsync-skip hides the
                     symptom from OAM reads.
  Scene transition   (town_arrival): FIELD (30,7) camera (96,0) -> shadow
                     OAM (72,152) -> gate -> TOWN (2,7) camera (0,0) ->
                     shadow OAM (72,27).
  Dialogue entry     (mayor): the dialogue must NOT wipe the world behind
                     the box (the map is already on screen from the
                     overworld).  Detected by breakpoint at ui_draw_world_full
                     (must not fire); the sprite stays visible behind the box
                     at (56,80).

IMPORTANT -- which OAM to read, and why these are the observable states:

* Shadow OAM (0xC000) is the authoritative position source: every sprite
  move writes shadow OAM and ui_sprite_commit() DMAs it to real OAM at the
  frame boundary.  Real OAM (0xFE00) reads at arbitrary harness pauses are
  often access-restricted (mGBA returns 0xFF during scanout modes 2/3), so
  the assertions read shadow OAM, which is always readable.

* The "hidden DURING the wipe" state (y=0 while the full-screen redraw is
  mid-sweep) is NOT observable under the harness: g_harness_mode skips
  vsync, so ui_sprite_begin_transition()'s hide and the frame-boundary
  commit complete within a single frame and no pause point lands between
  them (AGENTS.md 52.15).  The old assertions for a mid-wipe (0,..) state
  are therefore removed; what IS verified is that the sprite is at the
  correct position before and after each transition, and (via breakpoint)
  that ui_sprite_begin_transition fires on the transition frame but not on
  steady frames.

Each section runs in its own EmulatorSession so the extra breakpoints armed
by the checks (begin_transition, ui_draw_world_full) cannot contaminate the
next section's frame stepping.

Run inside the Nix dev shell:
    make verify-oam
or: nix develop --command python3 tools/verify_oam.py

Exits non-zero if any assertion fails.
